# benchmark-data
This repo contains the numerically exact results for various multi-dimensional model systems obtained with Tensor-Train (TT) methods lincluding TT-KSL (zero temperature) and TT-TFD (finite temperature) and 1-dimensional systems obtained with SOFT approach.

The spin-boson, LVC, retinal, Tully, LCP models are reported in the following work:
