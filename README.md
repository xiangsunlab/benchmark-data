# benchmark-data
This repo contains the numerically exact results for various multi-dimensional model systems obtained with TT-KSL (zero temperature) and TT-TFD (finite temperature) and 1-dimensional systems obtained with SOFT approach.

This dataset accompanies the following work:

* Benchmarking Various Nonadiabatic Semiclassical Mapping Dynamics Methods with Tensor-Train Thermo-Field Dynamics, by Zengkui Liu, Ningyi Lyu, Zhubin Hu, Hao Zeng, Victor S. Batista, and Xiang Sun.
